                <div class="para">
                    <p>Hello! I am <em>Kashav Piya</em>.</p>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Data Science at Augustana College. My passions lie in Software Development, Data Analytics, as well as Artificial Intelligence, and I look forward to combining these
                        together in order to succeed in my future career. I started my programming journey first when I started learning HTML and QBASIC in middle school. I immediately fell attracted to the concept of programming as I continued to learn
                        Visual Basic, C++, Python, Java, CSS through high-school and college. Along with programming, artificial intelligence has also captured my attention, and I have decided to continue this passion by pursuing a career in the field
                        of computer technology. My first step towards my career goal was moving to the United States to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in 2019. I love the idea of using data and technology side-by-side to make the world an easier, better
                        and safer place to live in. I am well versed with the Creative Cloud Suite, Office Tools including Excel and Access, Tableau, SQL, Git and Github. I am currently learning and working on my own project on neural networks. I am also
                        familiar with business planning, basic accounting and economics which I believe are important tools for the fast paced world we live in today. I look forward to sharing my work and knowledge with you, and I hope to explore the
                        future of the technology industry together.</p>

                    <p>Computer Science is something that I am extremely passionate about because I believe it can be an answer to all our questions, and a solution to all our problems. Having worked as a Computer Science tutor at my college, as well as
                        working on my own projects, I have experience in programming. Combining my experience with my aptitude for problem solving and my result-driven nature, I believe I can achieve great success in this industry. </p>

                    <p>I am currently seeking an internship opportunity related to development that will allow me to immerse myself in the industry in a professional environment. I am eager to continue enhancing my knowledge about this industry, and excited
                        to see what my future holds.
