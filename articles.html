                <p>Autonomous Vehicles are vehicles that can drive by themselves and do not require any human input to operate it. With new inventions, new problems and limitations arise. We have identified and highlighted three main issues. Naturalness
                    of Interaction with Autonomous Vehicles. Acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles. Ethical Issues in Autonomous Vehicles. We have identified and expanded on these problems and illustrated the cost benefit analysis of Autonomous Vehicles.
                    We have gone through the challenges that Autonomous Vehicles face and to provide a perspective, we have included results and steps taken by some of the companies leading in Autonomous Vehicles(AV) technology. We argue that there is
                    still a long way to go before a fully automated vehicle can hit the roads safely.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In the twenty first century, with the rise of technology, gaming industry has gone through a revolution with the introduction of augmented reality and virtual reality. From 1950s Sensorama which used seat motion, stereo sound, wind and
                    aromas to todayâ€™s flight simulators which uses the total science behind flying an aeroplane, we have come a long way in this field of technology. Virtual reality and gaming goes hand in hand and we have seen dramatic improvements in
                    both the sectors simultaneously. Games involving virtual reality is not only used for entertainment purposes but also in industries like education, health, real estate, advertising, tourism and many more. These games have positively
                    affected a lot of industries and are getting a lot of attention from the gaming community as well. Virtual reality is a multimodal, interactive technology that has made communication more natural, helped in improving health of users,
                    made learning easier, and made entertainment more realistic. We have seen in the trends that games involving Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality have become more and more successful and appealing to the gaming community. In this study,
                    we are trying to see if virtual reality is going to be the future of gaming as we go through data from different games that are considered successful. We try to see if it is really the virtual reality feature that makes it stand out
                    from the other games or is there some other factor that makes it popular amongst gamers.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In the twenty-first century, Internet of Things (IoT) has boomed to be impossible to relate to. From computers, mobile phones to your smart watches or virtual assistants, everything is connected to the complex web of IoT. With the technological
                    development in this century, healthcare sector has also had its fair share of innovations including innovation related to healthcare, diagnostics, sensors, or even data analytic along with development in Machine Learning and Artificial
                    Intelligence. IoT in healthcare is expected to help improve the quality of life for the people due to the flexibility that it provides. We looked at the significant amount of work done in this sector, and we found a trend that COVID19
                    has only spurred the development of this field. We explored both the benefits and challenges that IoT in Healthcare might possess. We have addressed challenges such as data security, cloud integration problems. Additionally, we looked
                    at the issue of data security in depth and along with the current method of LSCSH being used, we have recommended that Zero-trust architecture being used as well as it caters to the needs of the evolving data management space. Also,
                    we found that IoT in healthcare comes with lots of benefits including healthcare being easy to afford, being able to access it from anywhere and anytime, being able to save time and resources, medical records being easily accessible
                    to the healthcare providers, and many more. We investigated the rapid advancements of IoT in healthcare with devices available for use as of March 2021, and devices to be available soon. From 2013, IoT in healthcare has dominated the
                    space as new devices are released and there has been a boom of devices that are being developed and being researched on. Most of the devices are affordable and some can even be accessed with a small subscription fee. Our results show
                    us that IoT has started to pick up its popularity since 2015 as companies succeeded to win the trust of the market. Also, the advantages that it provides over regular healthcare has made IoT in Healthcare dominant. It looks like IoT
                    in healthcare is just getting started as these IoT technologies are ready to pick up its popularity in the coming years. Even though most of the development for these technologies look to come in the future, the progress made in the
                    recent years look promising.</p>
